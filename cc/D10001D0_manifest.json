Although evolution is most commonly associated with the biological theory explaining the process of descent with modification of organisms from common ancestors, evolution also describes changes in the universe.&lt;br \/&gt;&lt;br \/&gt; Equilibrium is a physical state in which forces and changes occur in opposite and off-setting directions: for example, opposite forces are of the same magnitude, or off-setting changes occur at equal rates. Steady state, balance, and homeostasis also describe equilibrium states. Interacting units of matter tend toward equilibrium states in which the energy is distributed as randomly and uniformly as possible.","language":"en-US"},"asn_authorityStatus":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNAuthorityStatus\/Original","prefLabel":"Original"},"dcterms_language":{"uri":"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/iso639-2\/eng","prefLabel":"English"},"asn_indexingStatus":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNIndexingStatus\/Yes","prefLabel":"Yes"},"dcterms_subject":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNTopic\/science","prefLabel":"Science"},"dcterms_educationLevel":[{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/K","prefLabel":"K"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/1","prefLabel":"1"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/2","prefLabel":"2"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/3","prefLabel":"3"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/4","prefLabel":"4"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/5","prefLabel":"5"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/6","prefLabel":"6"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/7","prefLabel":"7"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/8","prefLabel":"8"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/9","prefLabel":"9"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/10","prefLabel":"10"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/11","prefLabel":"11"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/12","prefLabel":"12"}],"leaf":"true"}]},{"id":"http:\/\/asn.jesandco.org\/resources\/S102DBAD","asn_identifier":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/resources\/S102DBAD","text":"Form and Function","dcterms_description":{"literal":"Form and Function","language":"en-US"},"asn_authorityStatus":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNAuthorityStatus\/Original","prefLabel":"Original"},"dcterms_language":{"uri":"http:\/\/id.loc.gov\/vocabulary\/iso639-2\/eng","prefLabel":"English"},"asn_indexingStatus":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNIndexingStatus\/Yes","prefLabel":"Yes"},"dcterms_subject":{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNTopic\/science","prefLabel":"Science"},"dcterms_educationLevel":[{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/K","prefLabel":"K"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/1","prefLabel":"1"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/2","prefLabel":"2"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/3","prefLabel":"3"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/4","prefLabel":"4"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/5","prefLabel":"5"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/6","prefLabel":"6"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/7","prefLabel":"7"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/8","prefLabel":"8"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/9","prefLabel":"9"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/10","prefLabel":"10"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/11","prefLabel":"11"},{"uri":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/scheme\/ASNEducationLevel\/12","prefLabel":"12"}],"cls":"folder","children":[{"id":"http:\/\/asn.jesandco.org\/resources\/S102DBB2","asn_identifier":"http:\/\/purl.org\/ASN\/resources\/S102DBB2","text":"Form and function are complementary aspects of objects, organisms, and systems in the natural and designed world.
